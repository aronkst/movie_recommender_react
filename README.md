# Movie Recommender React

This is the front-end project for [Movie Recommender](https://github.com/aronkst/movie-recommender).

The front-end was developed using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and its use must be combined with the back-end that was developed in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) and [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

Clone this project and make your build, with the built files, copy with the back-end executable and execute it, making the server live, which will load the front-end files. Now just access the server and you will have access to the application.
